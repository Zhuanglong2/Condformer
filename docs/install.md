## Installation

### Requirements

- Linux
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.3+
- CUDA 9.2+ (If you build PyTorch from source, CUDA 9.0 is also compatible)
- GCC 4.9+
- [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv)


### Install mmdetection

a. Create a conda virtual environment and activate it.

```shell
conda create -n open-mmlab python=3.7 -y
conda activate open-mmlab
```

b. Install PyTorch and torchvision following the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/), e.g.,

```shell
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```

Note: Make sure that your compilation CUDA version and runtime CUDA version match.
You can check the supported CUDA version for precompiled packages on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/).

`E.g.1` If you have CUDA 10.1 installed under `/usr/local/cuda` and would like to install
PyTorch 1.5, you need to install the prebuilt PyTorch with CUDA 10.1.

```python
conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=10.1 torchvision -c pytorch
```

`E.g. 2` If you have CUDA 9.2 installed under `/usr/local/cuda` and would like to install
PyTorch 1.3.1., you need to install the prebuilt PyTorch with CUDA 9.2.

```python
conda install pytorch=1.3.1 cudatoolkit=9.2 torchvision=0.4.2 -c pytorch
```

If you build PyTorch from source instead of installing the prebuilt pacakge,
you can use more CUDA versions such as 9.0.

c. Clone the mmdetection repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aliyun/conditional-lane-detection.git
cd conditional-lane-detection
```

d. Install build requirements and then install mmdetection.
(We install pycocotools via the github repo instead of pypi because the pypi version is old and not compatible with the latest numpy.)

```shell
pip install -r requirements/build.txt
python setup.py develop
```
